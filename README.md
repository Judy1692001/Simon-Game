An interactive web-based version of the classic Simon memory game. This project challenges players to repeat increasingly complex sequences of button presses. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery, the game features a visually engaging interface with colored buttons that light up in a sequence. Players must click the buttons in the same order to progress through levels. The project includes sound effects and animations to enhance user experience. Upon failure, the game provides feedback and restarts to allow players another attempt.
